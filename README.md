# Hangman
Hangman a python game

-- How to play -- 

* Game not tested on mac!
* Game not ready perfectly but it's work.
* You must have python installed on your machine, if not, you can download it here -> https://www.python.org/

How to start:
* Run Hangman.py , enter path to file that include words, 
  all words must be low case and have one space separated them, otherwise it will not work.
* For example you have file with fruit words - so you can input it like that: 

	Enter file path:demo_fruits_words.txt
	
	or full path to file if it in other directory for example: 
	
	Enter file path:c:\words\demo_fruits_words.txt
	
* Next you need to input index (only number) - it will choose a word from words list file, by counting them.

    --  IF one of the two steps are wrong, game will close immediately --
    
* That's it, start and try to guess the word!

  Good Luck!
